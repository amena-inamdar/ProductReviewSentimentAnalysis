SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON AN AMAZON PRODUCT BASED ON IT’S REVIEWS
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves determining the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In the context of analyzing Amazon product reviews, sentiment analysis helps us understand how customers feel about a particular product by extracting insights from their reviews. The goal is to categorize these reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on the language and emotions conveyed. The amazon product that I chose for this activity was “Verilux Flash Drive 64GB 4 in 1 Pendrive with Light-ning, Micro USB, USB A, Type-C Interface Mini Hangable Pen Drive for iOS & Android Compatible with Phone, Pad, Android, PC and More Devices”.
First, I made a csv file named “reviews.csv” constituting 50 random reviews for this product. The second step was text pre-processing in which the following 5 major steps were performed-
1. Conversion of text to lowercase.
2. Removal of Stop Words
3. Tokenization
4. Stemming
5. Lemmatization
After that, conclusions for sentiment analysis were drawn.
All these programs were executed in Jupyter Notebook (through Anaconda Navigator).
