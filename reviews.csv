1,Raunav Dasgupta,"The product is okay, you can easily transfer the files, it is much needed for IOS users, its hassle free, the only problematic thing is that, once your screen display is off, this product will be disconnected. You need to keep your display on from settings. The main concern is the price, it is way costly, the price should be around 1700, then okay.  Overall a decent product.",4,6
2,SUMAN,I am using it with my iPhone 13 and it works perfectly. Only one problem I found that is about its app functionality. When taking back up if screen locked after timeout it stops back up. This app should keep phone unlocked while itâ€™s working but itâ€™s missing. I hope this is an improvement idea for the app.,4,2
3,Deepak nagpal,This is a very compact pendrive and it holds tons of pictures. My iCloud was almost full so I downloaded all my pictures and saved them on this small drive just by plugging it right into my iPhone.Now that I have freed up more space on my phone I can take more pictures and not have to worry about running out of room ever again. Very convenient and easy,5,0
